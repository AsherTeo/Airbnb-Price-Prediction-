I started StayCentral when I purchased one apartment in 2005, and now manage multiple properties in many different locations in inner Melbourne.

Like many of my guests, I love to travel; both overseas on epic journeys (including remote locations like the Mulu Caves in Borneo, ancient cities (in Nepal, Turkey, Peru & Jordan), Antarctica & Alaska, Torres del Paine and colourful markets in amazing places like Fa Long in Vietnam, Jaisalmer in India, & La Paz in Bolivia). I also love short domestic trips for weekends away just to relax. It means I get to be on the other side of the counter, and experience how other people look after their guests: and I take their good ideas back with me. 

(My manager, Max, has also travelled from afar to be here btw, and he can also speak with our guests in Russian and Ukranian).

I even worked as a part-time tourist guide in Melbourne for a couple of years, and really enjoyed the interactions with the tourists off the huge cruise liners that appear in Melbourne each spring and summer. I have tried to extend this experience into my accommodation business here at home, where I really love assisting people with their stays. You only need to read the 550 or so reviews on Airbnb, Trip advisor, Goo gle, and on my own StayCentral website to realise how much our guests enjoy our apartments, and the way we look after them. 

I like keeping fit with gym work and roller-blading; often blading 30 kms or so on a day out. I cook for my mates once a month, and have done so since 2007. I cook and they bring the wine; my other love since coming to Melbourne in 2003.

I love living in Melbourne. It enjoys a unique place in Australia. It is often described as the cultural, business, shopping and sporting capital of the country. The restaurants and cafes in Melbourne are amongst the best in the world. I love living in an urban village amongst these, and all the other everyday shops; and jumping on a tram and avoiding the hassles of traffic. It is a city of great opportunity, experiences, events and lifestyle that can be enjoyed by locals and visitors alike; and I really enjoy facilitating our guests' stays here.

StayCentral Melbourne Corporate Apartments is a unique group of serviced apartments in central Melbourne. We offer boutique short and long-stay accommodation for relocations, family holidays and getaways. Our comfortable apartments have also been enjoyed by employees and contractors, executives and people needing temporary accommodation. We even have many pet-friendly apartments available! We provide excellent customer service from the time you first contact us to make a booking, through to the end of your stay.

All of our properties from one-bedroom apartments to seven-bedroom mansions are close to all the everyday things our guests would need during their stay; from cafes, restaurants and supermarkets, to shops, trams and nightlife - yet all locations are generally very quiet.

All of our interiors have been designed by experienced interior designers, and you will experience that feeling of ""I'm home!"" when you walk in, make yourself a cuppa and put your feet up. We supply far more than tea and coffee etc. There are many extras that make your stay more pleasant for our guests; including shopping trolleys, free Netflix in most properties, umbrellas and book exchanges.

If you book with me you'll be communicating with both myself and my staff.

I’m an entrepreneur, architecture graduate, photographer, cyclist (NOT the lycra kind), volunteer, adventurer and problem solver.

During my studies I worked at various cafes and architecture offices to save up for shoestring trips around the world. My grandma once told me I had ‘champagne taste but a beer budget’ and it’s a motto I’ve enjoyed applying to different parts of my life to get the more out of less and find enjoyment in the little things.

I love discovering authentic experiences when I travel and I love being able to share the opportunity with others, to live like a local when they travel too.

Some of my most memorable trips have been couch-surfin across Russia while taking the Trans Siberian, living in Helsinki and learning to hand build furniture, riding a vintage steel bicycle through France to race in L’Eroica and buying a car on craigzlist in Los Angeles and driving across the south, east and north coasts to arrive in Vancouver.

My listings are all managed by Beyond a Room and are all given names that I think reflect the character of the property and area. My aim is to give guests a unique and local perspective on the location and share my knowledge and experience of this wonderful city with travellers so that they feel at home.

What I love the most about living in Melbourne is that Melbourne is a multicultural city where you can enjoy variety of foods, street arts and nature.

Both myself and my co-host Simon (both Airbnb Superhosts) have been hosting for more than 5 years. We will do our best to make sure you enjoy your stay with us! Our reviews speak for themselves!

Also have a look at my Airbnb guidebook where I listed some of the highlights of Melborne. Also I have a 'secret' list of my favorite foods specially prepared just for my guests! ;)

Why book with Superhost?
First what is a superhost? https://www.airbnb.com/superhost

As a guest, what could be worst then arriving at the Airbnb and find that the host has cancelled your booking! Your previous time which can be used to explore the city is now spend calling Airbnb and fanatically looking for another accommodation. You may even ended up blowing your travel  budget because what's available in the last minute is higher than what you originally booked.

Adam was born 26 years ago in beautiful Budapest, moved to Melbourne at the age of 12 and have lived here ever since. 
Currently completing my Masters in Mechatronic Engineering at Melb Uni, I enjoy making the most of my time off. I love to cook, photograph, travel, discover and be awed by this world and its mysteries with my beautiful wife, Anita. We have travelled, lived and worked together across 3 different continents, and have recently married in our birth home, in a small town near Budapest, in June, 2014. Although we have recently moved into our brand new apartment high up in the skyline of Melbourne CBD, we still love being tourists exploring our new home town of Melbourne.
We have, throughout our travels used AirBnb as guests with great pleasure, and through the positive experiences we decided to open our doors to host. We hope to meet many more travellers to tell us of their adventures, and share with us all the stunning places in the world to discover!

I'm Joel, i'm born and raised in Sydney, which is in my opinion one of the most beautiful major cities in the world. My goal in life is to one day visit every country in the world, I hold no bias to any of them and hope that I get the opportunity. So far I have visited 42 countries. Last year I spent 1 year travelling in South and Central America and loved the opportunity I had to learn Spanish. It was a great experience and one that I will never forget. 

My hobbies include all forms of board sports, skating, surfing and snowboarding primarily. I enjoy learning about new cultures especially their foods. I grew up in an Italian restaurant so my love for food and cooking is deeply engrained in my personality. 

My style of hosting and living life in general is pretty relaxed. I will do my best to greet you at the door and make your stay as enjoyable as possible. But if you just want to chill I can totally relate. 

I also love music and watching live music. I mostly go out to see House, deep house and techno music as that scene in Sydney is easily accessible. However at home you will find me listening to hip-hop, reggae, latin, afro-beat, jazz and anything with a smooth and funky beat. 

If you need recommendations about food or music in Sydney these are probably my two strongest topics, so please don't hesitate. 

Looking forward to meeting more crazy, fun and cool people through Airbnb.

During my studies I worked at various cafes and architecture offices to save up for shoestring trips around the world.

Some of my most memorable trips have been couch-surfin across Russia while taking the Trans Siberian, living in Helsinki and learning to hand build furniture, riding a vintage steel bicycle through France to race in L’Eroica and buying a car on craigzlist in Los Angeles and driving across the south, east and north coasts to arrive in Vancouver.

Honestly, being a host, it is not easy decision.
We have to make sure every details things in our place are the best to our guests. 
From check-in to check-out. It is an experience not only for guests. it is for us as well. It is the whole responsibilities. 

That’s what I think, the reason which motivates me to be a host.

Melbourne is a very multi-cultural city 
My objective is, if someone come here they should be connected to the right place.
Me, as a host, I think is kind of connecting these different piece together, a kind of connection.
The high point of my stay was how you made me feel. And how you made me feel, it sticks. It sticks with you.”
I have the traditional way to believe.
We believe it is the relationship that provide to the guests they will enjoy,  love the place to stay.
They trust me and I trust them. And that’s the reason it works.

My grandma once told me I had ‘champagne taste but a beer budget’ and it’s a motto I’ve enjoyed applying to different parts of my life to get the more out of less and find enjoyment in the little things.

I love discovering authentic experiences when I travel and I love being able to share the opportunity with others, to live like a local when they travel too.

Some of my most memorable trips have been couch-surfin across Russia while taking the Trans Siberian, living in Helsinki and learning to hand build furniture, riding a vintage steel bicycle through France to race in L’Eroica and buying a car on craigzlist in Los Angeles and driving across the south, east and north coasts to arrive in Vancouver.

Throughout my professional life, i have been one to travel quite a lot - and know the importance of a safe, comfortable place to relax and unwind. Thanks for checking out my profile, hope to share my spaces with you soon! 

TOP 5 THINGS TO DO IN SOUTHBANK:

1)     NGV - what more can i say? Amazing place! 
2)    Melbourne Arts Centre - the Eiffel tower of Aus!
3)    Convention Centre - this is where the Terminator himself hosts his annual event. The "" Arnold Classic "". - You will be back ( there is also chopper rides ). 
4)    Eureka Skydeck 88.  297m high. You may need a drink following the experience. 
5)    PonyFish Island Bar. Cool spot for a Gin and Tonic. 

Look forward to speaking to you!

Please note: we would prefer someone who books for 4 weeks+, but 2x2+ will work too.","Where to start? I'm British/Australian and have also lived in Germany, Spain, Japan and Canada. After many years teaching English I now work as a Reiki teacher and life coach, but I'm definitely not one of those scary stereotypical hyperactive life coaches :) Being my own boss means choosing when I travel, which is often! I've visited many places but now mostly keep going back to India, Japan, France and Spain. I've been a Buddhist since University but most people wouldn't notice - I come across as ""normal"" :-) 
What do I like? Lots of things! Hiking, yoga, languages, conversation, reading about history/other cultures, animals (especially cats and geese). And food! (I'm vegetarian here at home but not usually when I'm travelling). 
As a guest I'm quiet, respectful, super-tidy but not bothered about chaos around me (I go to India, after all ...), and will feed your cat if you're out. I have a fun sense of humour and am tolerant and easy-going. 
I tend to spend longer periods in one place rather than rush around from city to city. My current trip is 2 months (December to February) in Europe where I'll be visiting my mother and an old uni friend, both in England, revisiting Germany in the snow, and then teaching Reiki in Amsterdam.",90

If you book with me you'll be communicating with both myself and my staff.

I’m an entrepreneur, architecture graduate, photographer, cyclist (NOT the lycra kind), volunteer, adventurer and problem solver.

During my studies I worked at various cafes and architecture offices to save up for shoestring trips around the world. My grandma once told me I had ‘champagne taste but a beer budget’ and it’s a motto I’ve enjoyed applying to different parts of my life to get the more out of less and find enjoyment in the little things.

I love discovering authentic experiences when I travel and I love being able to share the opportunity with others, to live like a local when they travel too.

Some of my most memorable trips have been couch-surfin across Russia while taking the Trans Siberian, living in Helsinki and learning to hand build furniture, riding a vintage steel bicycle through France to race in L’Eroica and buying a car on craigzlist in Los Angeles and driving across the south, east and north coasts to arrive in Vancouver.

My listings are all managed by Beyond a Room and are all given names that I think reflect the character of the property and area. My aim is to give guests a unique and local perspective on the location and share my knowledge and experience of this wonderful city with travellers so that they feel at home.

I am a modern expressionism art amateur, a diehard soccer fan and work in Digital Data Analytics. 

Airbnb is a good way to meet new people and I have a lovely apartment which I wouldn’t mind sharing with guests.

I am a French National from Paris but have lived in Melbourne for few years now and just love this city. I mean I might come from the city of lights but Melbourne is definitely the best city to live in the world. 

In my spare time I like exploring new places in the neighbourhood, attending gallery openings, going to museums, watching movies and concerts, trying new places to eat etc…I also enjoy traveling and have explored most of Europe and some countries in Asia and Africa. 

I really consider myself to be laid back, down-to-earth, and have enjoyed having roommates in the past. I try to be helpful and accommodating to anyone who visits me from out of town, always happy to give them advice about places to see in the city.

Ohh yeah, did I mention that I was also a gym junky and can really help with fitness and nutrition tips for those who might feel the need to work on their bodies :)  Afterall my life motto is “Pain is temporary and pride is forever”…

I’m an entrepreneur, architecture graduate, photographer, cyclist (NOT the lycra kind), volunteer, adventurer and problem solver.

During my studies I worked at various cafes and architecture offices to save up for shoestring trips around the world. My grandma once told me I had ‘champagne taste but a beer budget’ and it’s a motto I’ve enjoyed applying to different parts of my life to get the more out of less and find enjoyment in the little things.

I love discovering authentic experiences when I travel and I love being able to share the opportunity with others, to live like a local when they travel too.

Some of my most memorable trips have been couch-surfin across Russia while taking the Trans Siberian, living in Helsinki and learning to hand build furniture, riding a vintage steel bicycle through France to race in L’Eroica and buying a car on craigzlist in Los Angeles and driving across the south, east and north coasts to arrive in Vancouver.

I like to sleep in a luxurious 5-star hotel. I like mountain climbing, trekking, camping... I enjoy sleeping under the million stars in the wild. What I like most about traveling is to be able to get close to different people and culture. It never fails to amaze me. One of the most unforgettable places would be Nepal.

I'm Joel, i'm born and raised in Sydney, which is in my opinion one of the most beautiful major cities in the world. My goal in life is to one day visit every country in the world, I hold no bias to any of them and hope that I get the opportunity. So far I have visited 42 countries. Last year I spent 1 year travelling in South and Central America and loved the opportunity I had to learn Spanish. It was a great experience and one that I will never forget. 

My hobbies include all forms of board sports, skating, surfing and snowboarding primarily. I enjoy learning about new cultures especially their foods. I grew up in an Italian restaurant so my love for food and cooking is deeply engrained in my personality. 

My style of hosting and living life in general is pretty relaxed. I will do my best to greet you at the door and make your stay as enjoyable as possible. But if you just want to chill I can totally relate. 

I also love music and watching live music. I mostly go out to see House, deep house and techno music as that scene in Sydney is easily accessible. However at home you will find me listening to hip-hop, reggae, latin, afro-beat, jazz and anything with a smooth and funky beat. 

If you need recommendations about food or music in Sydney these are probably my two strongest topics, so please don't hesitate. 

Looking forward to meeting more crazy, fun and cool people through Airbnb.

A bit about me personally... I love to create: short films, corporate videos, music videos, lifestyle content, promo videos, birthday videos and more. Check out my YouTube Channel if you're interested. Just search CJI Productions in YouTube.

As an Airbnb Host my style is kind of 'flexible/adaptable' in that I mould to the needs of my guest(s). For example, you want a more visible host I would most likely meet you for check-in and checkout.  However, you'd prefer an invisible host I would arrange self check-in for your arrival. And of course, I'm only just a phone call away if you need me for anything at all.

I started StayCentral when I purchased one apartment in 2005, and now manage multiple properties in many different locations in inner Melbourne.

Like many of my guests, I love to travel; both overseas on epic journeys (including remote locations like the Mulu Caves in Borneo, ancient cities (in Nepal, Turkey, Peru & Jordan), Antarctica & Alaska, Torres del Paine and colourful markets in amazing places like Fa Long in Vietnam, Jaisalmer in India, & La Paz in Bolivia). I also love short domestic trips for weekends away just to relax. It means I get to be on the other side of the counter, and experience how other people look after their guests: and I take their good ideas back with me. 

(My manager, Max, has also travelled from afar to be here btw, and he can also speak with our guests in Russian and Ukranian).

I even worked as a part-time tourist guide in Melbourne for a couple of years, and really enjoyed the interactions with the tourists off the huge cruise liners that appear in Melbourne each spring and summer. I have tried to extend this experience into my accommodation business here at home, where I really love assisting people with their stays. You only need to read the 550 or so reviews on Airbnb, Trip advisor, Goo gle, and on my own StayCentral website to realise how much our guests enjoy our apartments, and the way we look after them. 

I like keeping fit with gym work and roller-blading; often blading 30 kms or so on a day out. I cook for my mates once a month, and have done so since 2007. I cook and they bring the wine; my other love since coming to Melbourne in 2003.

I love living in Melbourne. It enjoys a unique place in Australia. It is often described as the cultural, business, shopping and sporting capital of the country. The restaurants and cafes in Melbourne are amongst the best in the world. I love living in an urban village amongst these, and all the other everyday shops; and jumping on a tram and avoiding the hassles of traffic. It is a city of great opportunity, experiences, events and lifestyle that can be enjoyed by locals and visitors alike; and I really enjoy facilitating our guests' stays here.

StayCentral Melbourne Corporate Apartments is a unique group of serviced apartments in central Melbourne. We offer boutique short and long-stay accommodation for relocations, family holidays and getaways. Our comfortable apartments have also been enjoyed by employees and contractors, executives and people needing temporary accommodation. We even have many pet-friendly apartments available! We provide excellent customer service from the time you first contact us to make a booking, through to the end of your stay.

All of our properties from one-bedroom apartments to seven-bedroom mansions are close to all the everyday things our guests would need during their stay; from cafes, restaurants and supermarkets, to shops, trams and nightlife - yet all locations are generally very quiet.

All of our interiors have been designed by experienced interior designers, and you will experience that feeling of ""I'm home!"" when you walk in, make yourself a cuppa and put your feet up. We supply far more than tea and coffee etc. There are many extras that make your stay more pleasant for our guests; including shopping trolleys, free Netflix in most properties, umbrellas and book exchanges.

I'm a semi-driver with a syd-melb run 6 days a week.
Although I do enjoy the finer things life has to offer, I have  always appreciated a casual, easy going outlook on life. Always first to make fun of myself and keen to have a laugh. 
 An avid traveller that really revels in making the most of every moment!!

I hope to catch you at my Sydney or Melbourne apartments. As I'm residing and working between both cities, I can easily organise myself to check you in personally and perhaps after learning a bit about ur stay, I may have some savvy suggestions. 

Otherwise, Have a Helluva Happy time Hunting.... Syd/melb have so much to offer.

I love summer, walking around finding things, meeting people, writing, reading. Making ideas into objects or occurrences. For all sorts of life experience driven reasons. 

I'm working on a lifelong study of the creative and the community. Seeking signs of life, out there, of real people and their stories. Finding ways to ingest hope, opportunity, respect and a sense of the true value of places to individuals and to the broader society. Finding ways to create micro moments that might just spark life, into beautiful people whose flames can become embers when their tread gets loaded and weary. 

oh and of course I love music, especially the wonderfully inspiring people and artists that can be found around my home here in St Kilda. I'm 2 years (and counting) into an 'art-change'. If you can imagine, its a sea-change, where one leaves a perfectly good reliable career to take long observy walks, undertake immersive excursions and pour late into the nights hell bent on some particular creation.

Other than beds (which are new and very comfortable!!),  I love to buy antique and pre-loved furniture and  have them restored using classic and sometimes quirky fabrics. 

I'm proud to say that we have won numerous awards including 'tourism' and 'hospitality' at the Hobsons Bay region Business excellence awards (3 times) as well as taken out the People's Choice award for the state of Victoria twice in the last three awards.

AIRBNB HOSTING STORY:
I dived into the world of full time hosting in November (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) , after a restructure at my former employer prompted me to explore an idea which had been kicking around in my head since (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) 
 
I’ve since hosted over 300 groups, however I still feel like I'm just getting started, with more ideas than hours in the day! My current plans are for four listings spread around Melbourne, each offering different experiences and styled in different ways, each reflecting a little part of my personality.
 
My hosting style is all about:
— Providing great spaces to guests which surpass expectations 
— Taking the stress out of arriving in a new city by providing clear directions, self check in instructions & being very responsive with communication,
— Sharing local insights on Melbourne and its surroundings, so as to provide guests with a local experiences, and to enable them to discover things they may not have found sticking to the usual tourist haunts.
 
A LITTLE MORE ABOUT ME:
I was born in Melbourne, have lived in the Pilbara (Western Australia), have flown around the world a couple of times, am very good with airport security, and have an affinity for problem solving, organising spaces and improving things.
 
I have lived full time in the world's most liveable city since (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) , and love the coffee culture, craft beer, amazing food and street art the city has to offer - I'm looking forward to sharing this knowledge with my guests through my guidebooks.
 
AIRBNB TRAVEL STORY:
I first stayed with Airbnb in their hometown of San Francisco in (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) Since then I’ve stayed in peoples homes in Sydney, Munich, New York, Vancouver, Tulum, Mexico City, Courmayeur, Beaune & Amsterdam.

I enjoy travelling, discovering other peoples' way of life, interactions with diversified community is a continuous education, learn about their history, visiting Museums whenever possible.

I consider myself as kind, trustworthy, honest, respectable, resourceful, organized and clean.

I prefer staying with others for accommodation when travelling, not only cheaper but staying with locals also may help me to easily learn about the community, points of interest, the locals practices.

  I am  considerate, respectful and sensitive of others expectations. I abide by the hosts' house policies the same way  I expect my guests do the same.

I use all modes of transport when travelling. Airplanes, boats; cars; trains etc.

The many years of travelling and staying in various kind and styles of accommodation has given me knowledge on being a host. Finding out what works, what's lacking during my travels equipped me with  ideas on the ""Do's and Don't's""  on being a host.

I am happy being a host with Airbnb. I find it easy and comfortable doing business with them.

Your previous time which can be used to explore the city is now spend calling Airbnb and fanatically looking for another accommodation. You may even ended up blowing your travel budget because what's available in the last minute is higher than what you originally booked.

Originally from the UK I'm lucky enough to have the pleasure of calling Melbourne my home and owning a 2 bed apartment.  I have travelled a bit and lived in shared houses a fair bit in the past. I would be happy to give advise on melbourne if you need any.

I work in a regular office job (8-5ish mon-fri), play hockey so spend plenty of time training and playing.  I also try to get to some of the many restuarants/cafes.

I tend to be out a fair bit or you'll find my cooking or maybe watching something on Netflix.  I try and keep the place tidy.  

I have travelled a bit and have experienced massive shared dormitories to top notch hotels (through work!) to camping. Hopefully you agree I can offer a safe, homely place to stay with all the necessities you need (including plenty of tea as I work for a tea company!!) and am happy to share my tips.",125

That's the happiness that other job may not able to find it. I really love to see when my guests they start to step to the apartment and feel wow and impressed.
Honestly, being a host, it is not easy decision.
We have to make sure every details things in our place are the best to our guests. 
From check-in to check-out. It is an experience not only for guests. it is for us as well. It is the whole responsibilities. 

That’s what I think, the reason which motivates me to be a host.

Melbourne is a very multi-cultural city 
My objective is, if someone come here they should be connected to the right place.
Me, as a host, I think is kind of connecting these different piece together, a kind of connection.
The high point of my stay was how you made me feel. And how you made me feel, it sticks. It sticks with you.”
I have the traditional way to believe.
We believe it is the relationship that provide to the guests they will enjoy,  love the place to stay.
They trust me and I trust them. And that’s the reason it works.

Only been very new to Airbnb industry but I've done many years of Students Accomondation in the past. I love being a host, since I enjoy serving and making people feel special. I like to give people the warmth of feeling of being home but also a wow factor as they enter the place. And most importantly they feel it is worth their money! At my place guests will experience the unique Melbourne home design and our style of living, so that it will remains in their memories forever. And this is the gift I like to bring for my guests. 
As a guest, what could be worst then arriving at the Airbnb and find that the host has cancelled your booking! Your previous time which can be used to explore the city is now spend calling Airbnb and fanatically looking for another accommodation. You may even ended up blowing your travel budget because what's available in the last minute is higher than what you originally booked.

Booking with me means you will have a peace of mind and much lesser chance of having your booking cancelled.",100

My objective is, if someone come here they should be connected to the right place.
Me, as a host, I think is kind of connecting these different piece together, a kind of connection.
The high point of my stay was how you made me feel. And how you made me feel, it sticks. It sticks with you.”
I have the traditional way to believe.

During our travels we have stayed in many Airbnb's as guests and have thoroughly enjoyed our experiences, making many lifelong friends. This inspired us to host our own and invite others to our little slice of paradise. 
 
For us, family, friends and food make for good fellowship! We love sharing our beautiful farm and look forward to meeting you!",150

Being a Airbnb host for 5-6 years. I love being a host, because I know that when people, different group of people and family come to our place, when they feel, it is worth it. I love it and enjoy. That's the happiness that other job may not able to find it. I really love to see when my guests they start to step to the apartment and feel wow and impressed.
Honestly, being a host, it is not easy decision.
We have to make sure every details things in our place are the best to our guests. 
From check-in to check-out. It is an experience not only for guests. it is for us as well. It is the whole responsibilities. 

That’s what I think, the reason which motivates me to be a host.

Melbourne is a very multi-cultural city 
My objective is, if someone come here they should be connected to the right place.
Me, as a host, I think is kind of connecting these different piece together, a kind of connection.
The high point of my stay was how you made me feel. And how you made me feel, it sticks. It sticks with you.”
I have the traditional way to believe.
We believe it is the relationship that provide to the guests they will enjoy,  love the place to stay.
They trust me and I trust them. And that’s the reason it works.
So hospitalities if you ask me, is about care. It s about welcoming. This is about welcoming with open heart.  Welcome you to my Melbourne Apartment.",287

We have to make sure every details things in our place are the best to our guests. 
From check-in to check-out. It is an experience not only for guests. it is for us as well. It is the whole responsibilities.

Melbourne is a very multi-cultural city 
My objective is, if someone come here they should be connected to the right place.
Me, as a host, I think is kind of connecting these different piece together, a kind of connection.

I have the traditional way to believe.
We believe it is the relationship that provide to the guests they will enjoy,  love the place to stay.

My style of hosting and living life in general is pretty relaxed. I will do my best to greet you at the door and make your stay as enjoyable as possible. But if you just want to chill I can totally relate. 

I also love music and watching live music. I mostly go out to see House, deep house and techno music as that scene in Sydney is easily accessible. However at home you will find me listening to hip-hop, reggae, latin, afro-beat, jazz and anything with a smooth and funky beat.

I try to ensure my guests have the experience of a wonderful stay and make their trip to Melbourne (or Yarrawonga) a memorable one. I have travelled extensively myself and know how important it is to obtain information and assistance without too much bother.

You will see that there aren't too many reviews on my spaces considering the number of years that I have been hosting but that's due to the fact that many come and stay for longer periods as I provide significant discounts for stays of a month or more.

During my studies I worked at various cafes and architecture offices to save up for shoestring trips around the world. My grandma once told me I had ‘champagne taste but a beer budget’ and it’s a motto I’ve enjoyed applying to different parts of my life to get the more out of less and find enjoyment in the little things.

I love discovering authentic experiences when I travel and I love being able to share the opportunity with others, to live like a local when they travel too.

Some of my most memorable trips have been couch-surfin across Russia while taking the Trans Siberian, living in Helsinki and learning to hand build furniture, riding a vintage steel bicycle through France to race in L’Eroica and buying a car on craigzlist in Los Angeles and driving across the south, east and north coasts to arrive in Vancouver.

Architecture and geography make me tick. Travel is another passion and vice that I undertake as often as possible, usually more for work. Meeting people and sharing culture I believe makes for a global community. 

I eat everything. Love home-cooked, the organic, the considered and the cultured.

I like to be neat and orderly, and also love to have spontaneous times too- the essence of living. Hiking, gym, swimming and nature are part of my oxygen as much a a great urban lifestyle of coffee and books and magazines!

I'm a 20 years old undergraduate student currently studying commercial law. I like to watch movies and play video games. Sometimes I could spend my whole day in my room just play games. I thought that there isn't much things to do outside and I thought the World was a boring place. When I'm not playing games, I would read news on the internet just to catch up with the rest of the world. That's how I knew Airbnb. 

One day, my father come to me, talked about doing short term renting. He has got few new apartments that our relatives bought which needs to be rented out. I told him about Airbnb and he thought we could really make it work. So I asked my best friend if he is interested to be my partner for this, and he said yes. We started almost immediately, planning, buying furnitures to started taking guests in just two weeks. 

Then it really changed me.

I met with travellers around the world. Every body was so polite and friendly.  When I talk to them I can feel the excitement and happiness. It's totally  different compare to what I thought people are like. Maybe because this communicate is great, I don't know.  Then I  thought ""I want to be people like my guests"". I want people around me to feel life is great and there are a lot to look forward to. The guests really gave me a lot motivation towards my work and my life. Here I have to thank you all.

After one month, the revenue was great, however take away the interests and loans, all kinds of fees and salary for my partner, there are really not much left for me. But I think that's enough, I'm still a student, I have to spend time on study and don't have much things to spend money on anyway, being able to save money for a holiday with my girl friend every few month is perfect for me. 

After all these experience, I felt it really changed my life and how I view the world. Doesn't matter if I fail or succeed it's  going to effect the rest of my life in a very positive way, that's something really valuable to me.",133

It has four bedrooms and two separate living areas.  Outdoor living awaits you in the relaxing outdoor spaces. You choose from the large outdoor dining area, the pool and spa or sit around the fire on a chilly evening.  The house has ducted heating and ducted evaporative cooling.","We are a working couple with a labrador and three children that are growing too fast!  We like to get involved in our kids activities and volunteer at the local school and sporting clubs.  

We love living where we do and love our house and neighbourhood, particularly in the warmer months when we like to spend a lot of time in our backyard.  We are keen to share our space for others to enjoy, as we do as often as we can.

We mostly eat at home, either cooking on the Weber BBQ or using the Thermomix for a quick meal.  We love our appliances with the induction cooktop and large oven for cooking up a storm. 

We do enjoy dining out and have updated our Airbnb Guide Book with some of our local recommendations for restaurants, family friendly dining, takeaway food and entertainment.  We have also listed nearby parks and playgrounds, however have our local primary school very close by which is a great play space. 

When we are not at home we are usually camping or caravanning around our beautiful country and our dog comes with us.  We are new to Airbnb, but will definitively look at booking as a guest next time we go away without our van.  

As we are a family of five, we think our house would be best suited to another family, or could even negotiate two families.  We will try to make your stay as pleasant and comfortable as possible and are happy for you to call or message any queries when you are staying at our house.

Tyrone built both the Warburton Arch House and Lilly Pad, designed by local architect firm Soft Loud House Architects.  The entire build was covered by TV show Grand Designs Australia and aired in 2012.  

Tyrone is an artisan builder & sculptor and  built everything on the property from the house to the dry stone walls, the waterfall and native garden.  Hailey is a social entrepreneur that builds partnerships between corporate Australia and charities.  Both live and work from the Warburton Arch house but travel also.

Tyrone is passionate about fly fishing, science fiction, good food and landscape sculpting.  Hailey is known for her gourmet salads (inspired by Ottolenghi) and her quirky sense of humour.  Both appreciate elegant food, good wine and quality conversation.  We're friendly, thoughtful and proud to share our dream home with new people and provide a little distraction from the busyness of daily life.  

Tyrone's ambition for 2017 is to be accepted into the Sculptures by the Sea competition and Hailey is very excited about her upcoming stage appearance alongside His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

Shannon is a music nerd and a fine cook. We both enjoy cooking and eating. There are so many fantastic restaurants from many cultures in Melbourne so we are really spoiled for choice. To sum us up, we are happy, creative people who love our city and the culture that surrounds us. We are both guests and hosts on air bnb, so we understand what makes a great stay. We hope you choose to stay with us. Best wishes and happy travels!",150

Live for travel, good food, coffee and dogs! 
I love Australia and enjoy giving guests tips to see our beautiful country outside of the city. 
I am also a respite foster parent for our first nations children, when I'm not hosting Airbnb guests in my home. I have a passion for protecting our first nations people and protecting their culture and land. I am open minded, queer accepting and believe in building connection, not bridges. 
As a guest, I'm very clean and appreciate a fresh set of linen and a comfy bed.  I have a laid back approach to travel and my Airbnb stays and would much prefer to be immersed in culture, than resort style living. 
I enjoy meeting new people from around the world and connecting over food. Food for me, means connection. 
I work full time running my Airbnb management business that helps hosts throughout Melbourne run their Airbnbs and assist their guests. 
I am a responsible guest who will leave your home very clean. If my dogs are travelling with me, I will always clean up after them, supervise them and keep them off your furniture. My boys are very well behaved and are used to travelling and staying in new places. 
I look forward to hosting you sometime or being a guest in your home :)",55

During my studies I worked at various cafes and architecture offices to save up for shoestring trips around the world. My grandma once told me I had ‘champagne taste but a beer budget’ and it’s a motto I’ve enjoyed applying to different parts of my life to get the more out of less and find enjoyment in the little things.

I love discovering authentic experiences when I travel and I love being able to share the opportunity with others, to live like a local when they travel too.

Some of my most memorable trips have been couch-surfin across Russia while taking the Trans Siberian, living in Helsinki and learning to hand build furniture, riding a vintage steel bicycle through France to race in L’Eroica and buying a car on craigzlist in Los Angeles and driving across the south, east and north coasts to arrive in Vancouver.

I'm Joel, i'm born and raised in Sydney, which is in my opinion one of the most beautiful major cities in the world. My goal in life is to one day visit every country in the world, I hold no bias to any of them and hope that I get the opportunity. So far I have visited 42 countries. Last year I spent 1 year travelling in South and Central America and loved the opportunity I had to learn Spanish. It was a great experience and one that I will never forget. 

My hobbies include all forms of board sports, skating, surfing and snowboarding primarily. I enjoy learning about new cultures especially their foods. I grew up in an Italian restaurant so my love for food and cooking is deeply engrained in my personality. 

My style of hosting and living life in general is pretty relaxed. I will do my best to greet you at the door and make your stay as enjoyable as possible. But if you just want to chill I can totally relate. 

I also love music and watching live music. I mostly go out to see House, deep house and techno music as that scene in Sydney is easily accessible. However at home you will find me listening to hip-hop, reggae, latin, afro-beat, jazz and anything with a smooth and funky beat. 

If you need recommendations about food or music in Sydney these are probably my two strongest topics, so please don't hesitate. 

Looking forward to meeting more crazy, fun and cool people through Airbnb.

We love being airbnb hosts and sharing our homes and our beautiful city with others.
We have been airbnb hosts for over four years and during that time we have met amazing and wonderful people from all around Australia and all parts of the world.
We started with the spare room in our own home and now have 20 properties, from high end luxury to family friendly apartments that we offer our guests. We even have a 7 bedroom, 7 bathroom mansion near the sea in St Kilda for larger groups! 
We use airbnb ourselves whenever we travel and feel we know what people are looking for. Good value, great locations, clean, comfortable and friendly! All our properties are in great locations, are professionally cleaned and we use hotel quality, commercially laundered linen on comfortable beds.  We meet all our guests on arrival to say hello and are on hand to offer help, advice and inside tips of places to go and things to see. 
Most of our properties include free parking which is a real bonus in the city and Foxtel (cable) television and other homely touches so you 'can live like a local'. (You can view our properties by clicking the View Full Profile link below and clicking on the listings on the left hand side of the page). 

A little bit about ourselves ... we're pretty easy going, and love getting out and about exploring different places. We are both keen travellers and have done our fair share of it in Australia and overseas - whether backpacking, camping, or an occasional splurge on 5-star resorts! You wouldn't call us 'party animals', but we do like socialising and meeting people.  We enjoy a wide variety of interests, love the movies, eating out, popping down to the beach on our scooter or pushbikes, and enjoying the many exciting sporting events and festivals that Melbourne has to offer.
Our motto is ""strangers are just friends you haven't met yet!""
Wishing you happy travels and looking forward to meeting you soon :-)

Thanks for taking the time to read our profile. 

We are a regular Aussie family with a home that many tell us has a relaxed and welcoming vibe. Which is GREAT because that’s how we want you to feel when you stay with us. 
You need to know that our home is not a sterile hotel, or a grungy hostel or even a display home. There is the normal detritus of modern family life with children. But that aside you can be assured your environment will be clean, your linens fresh and your room cleaned and dusted before you arrive. There can be a lot of laughter, love (the occasional tantrum) in our home, and you are welcome to share in that, or to have privacy and limited interaction if that is your preference. We will be led by you. ☺

Above all we just want you to be comfortable!

We love keeping fit. Enjoying time with friends. A good red wine or a craft beer AND of course travelling!!

We have been having airbnb guests for 5 years now. It has been truly rewarding and we have met remarkable people from every continent, many we are still friends or in contact with. 

We look forward to meeting you too ☺.",130

As a guest, what could be worst then arriving at the Airbnb and find that the host has cancelled your booking! Your previous time which can be used to explore the city is now spend calling Airbnb and fanatically looking for another accommodation. You may even ended up blowing your travel  budget because what's available in the last minute is higher than what you originally booked.

Ev","A mining engineer by profession, I have owned two other service businesses since 1998. I started StayCentral when I purchased one apartment in 2005, and now manage multiple properties in many different locations in inner Melbourne.

Like many of my guests, I love to travel; both overseas on epic journeys (including remote locations like the Mulu Caves in Borneo, ancient cities (in Nepal, Turkey, Peru & Jordan), Antarctica & Alaska, Torres del Paine and colourful markets in amazing places like Fa Long in Vietnam, Jaisalmer in India, & La Paz in Bolivia). I also love short domestic trips for weekends away just to relax. It means I get to be on the other side of the counter, and experience how other people look after their guests: and I take their good ideas back with me. 

(My manager, Max, has also travelled from afar to be here btw, and he can also speak with our guests in Russian and Ukranian).

I even worked as a part-time tourist guide in Melbourne for a couple of years, and really enjoyed the interactions with the tourists off the huge cruise liners that appear in Melbourne each spring and summer. I have tried to extend this experience into my accommodation business here at home, where I really love assisting people with their stays. You only need to read the 550 or so reviews on Airbnb, Trip advisor, Goo gle, and on my own StayCentral website to realise how much our guests enjoy our apartments, and the way we look after them. 

I like keeping fit with gym work and roller-blading; often blading 30 kms or so on a day out. I cook for my mates once a month, and have done so since 2007. I cook and they bring the wine; my other love since coming to Melbourne in 2003.

I love living in Melbourne. It enjoys a unique place in Australia. It is often described as the cultural, business, shopping and sporting capital of the country. The restaurants and cafes in Melbourne are amongst the best in the world. I love living in an urban village amongst these, and all the other everyday shops; and jumping on a tram and avoiding the hassles of traffic. It is a city of great opportunity, experiences, events and lifestyle that can be enjoyed by locals and visitors alike; and I really enjoy facilitating our guests' stays here.

StayCentral Melbourne Corporate Apartments is a unique group of serviced apartments in central Melbourne. We offer boutique short and long-stay accommodation for relocations, family holidays and getaways. Our comfortable apartments have also been enjoyed by employees and contractors, executives and people needing temporary accommodation. We even have many pet-friendly apartments available!

All of our properties from one-bedroom apartments to seven-bedroom mansions are close to all the everyday things our guests would need during their stay; from cafes, restaurants and supermarkets, to shops, trams and nightlife - yet all locations are generally very quiet.

All of our interiors have been designed by experienced interior designers, and you will experience that feeling of ""I'm home!"" when you walk in, make yourself a cuppa and put your feet up. We supply far more than tea and coffee etc. There are many extras that make your stay more pleasant for our guests; including shopping trolleys, free Netflix in most properties, umbrellas and book exchanges.

Thanks for viewing my profile!

What I love the most about living in Melbourne is that Melbourne is a multicultural city where you can enjoy variety of foods, street arts and nature.

Both myself and my co-host Simon (both Airbnb Superhosts) have been hosting for more than 5 years. We will do our best to make sure you enjoy your stay with us! Our reviews speak for themselves!

Also have a look at my Airbnb guidebook where I listed some of the highlights of Melborne. Also I have a 'secret' list of my favorite foods specially prepared just for my guests! ;)

Why book with Superhost?
First what is a superhost? https://www.airbnb.com/superhost

As a guest, what could be worst then arriving at the Airbnb and find that the host has cancelled your booking! Your previous time which can be used to explore the city is now spend calling Airbnb and fanatically looking for another accommodation. You may even ended up blowing your travel  budget because what's available in the last minute is higher than what you originally booked.

Booking with Superhost means you peace of mind and much lesser chance of having your booking cancelled.",138

I’m an entrepreneur, architecture graduate, photographer, cyclist (NOT the lycra kind), volunteer, adventurer and problem solver.

During my studies I worked at various cafes and architecture offices to save up for shoestring trips around the world. My grandma once told me I had ‘champagne taste but a beer budget’ and it’s a motto I’ve enjoyed applying to different parts of my life to get the more out of less and find enjoyment in the little things.

I love discovering authentic experiences when I travel and I love being able to share the opportunity with others, to live like a local when they travel too.

Some of my most memorable trips have been couch-surfin across Russia while taking the Trans Siberian, living in Helsinki and learning to hand build furniture, riding a vintage steel bicycle through France to race in L’Eroica and buying a car on craigzlist in Los Angeles and driving across the south, east and north coasts to arrive in Vancouver.

I’m Mel from Melbourne, Australia, and I live with my partner, Fabrizio, from Bologna, Italy. 

We try to travel and explore the world, as much as possible. We love experiencing different cultures and enjoying great food!
We prefer to experience the local culture, rather than stopping only a couple of days in a place, and heading on to the next location. Meeting the locals is what makes the experience all the more worthwhile! Airbnb is great for this :)

We have had many people stay with us over the last couple of years, and have really enjoyed each and every experience. 

What is important about Airbnb is the relationship and communication between the host and the guest. So far we’ve had some great experiences, and hope this continues.",75

I’m an entrepreneur, architecture graduate, photographer, cyclist (NOT the lycra kind), volunteer, adventurer and problem solver.

During my studies I worked at various cafes and architecture offices to save up for shoestring trips around the world. My grandma once told me I had ‘champagne taste but a beer budget’ and it’s a motto I’ve enjoyed applying to different parts of my life to get the more out of less and find enjoyment in the little things.

I love discovering authentic experiences when I travel and I love being able to share the opportunity with others, to live like a local when they travel too.

Some of my most memorable trips have been couch-surfin across Russia while taking the Trans Siberian, living in Helsinki and learning to hand build furniture, riding a vintage steel bicycle through France to race in L’Eroica and buying a car on craigzlist in Los Angeles and driving across the south, east and north coasts to arrive in Vancouver.

My listings are all managed by Beyond a Room and are all given names that I think reflect the character of the property and area.

As a guest, what could be worst then arriving at the Airbnb and find that the host has cancelled your booking! Your previous time which can be used to explore the city is now spend calling Airbnb and fanatically looking for another accommodation. You may even ended up blowing your travel  budget because what's available in the last minute is higher than what you originally booked.

We love being airbnb hosts and sharing our homes and our beautiful city with others.
We have been airbnb hosts for over four years and during that time we have met amazing and wonderful people from all around Australia and all parts of the world.
We started with the spare room in our own home and now have 20 properties, from high end luxury to family friendly apartments that we offer our guests. We even have a 7 bedroom, 7 bathroom mansion near the sea in St Kilda for larger groups! 
We use airbnb ourselves whenever we travel and feel we know what people are looking for. Good value, great locations, clean, comfortable and friendly! All our properties are in great locations, are professionally cleaned and we use hotel quality, commercially laundered linen on comfortable beds.  We meet all our guests on arrival to say hello and are on hand to offer help, advice and inside tips of places to go and things to see. 
Most of our properties include free parking which is a real bonus in the city and Foxtel (cable) television and other homely touches so you 'can live like a local'. (You can view our properties by clicking the View Full Profile link below and clicking on the listings on the left hand side of the page). 

A little bit about ourselves ... we're pretty easy going, and love getting out and about exploring different places. We are both keen travellers and have done our fair share of it in Australia and overseas - whether backpacking, camping, or an occasional splurge on 5-star resorts! You wouldn't call us 'party animals', but we do like socialising and meeting people.  We enjoy a wide variety of interests, love the movies, eating out, popping down to the beach on our scooter or pushbikes, and enjoying the many exciting sporting events and festivals that Melbourne has to offer.
Our motto is ""strangers are just friends you haven't met yet!""
Wishing you happy travels and looking forward to meeting you soon :-)

During my studies I worked at various cafes and architecture offices to save up for shoestring trips around the world. My grandma once told me I had ‘champagne taste but a beer budget’ and it’s a motto I’ve enjoyed applying to different parts of my life to get the more out of less and find enjoyment in the little things.

Some of my most memorable trips have been couch-surfin across Russia while taking the Trans Siberian, living in Helsinki and learning to hand build furniture, riding a vintage steel bicycle through France to race in L’Eroica and buying a car on craigzlist in Los Angeles and driving across the south, east and north coasts to arrive in Vancouver.
