We are passionate about traveling, exploring, and sharing. Bitten by the travel bug when we were young, we love to jump on a plane and explore the world. Spending our days and nights away from home with new friends, exchanging our experiences, and building new unforgettable memories. LittleStay is here to help create those memories. 

That's the idyllic part, but in our real life we all have bills, mortgages and obligations that we wish we could leave at home and don't have to travel with.

Consequentially LittleStay was born to help with that dream, a company that allow people like us and others to travel, live, experience or start a new life without the everyday struggle of life back “home”.

LittleStay wants you to feel comfortable entrusting us with your largest asset. We will consider your home our home while we manage it. It is our reputation on the line if something is amiss. We do not take that lightly.  LittleStay wants you to be a part of our LittleFamily. We value your partnership and thusly, if you are holidaying and want to stay at one of our properties, you’ll receive insider rates. You can even reserve your own property for your family and friends that are visiting. 

We take care of virtually everything. Our level of cleaning is second to none. Our customer service is beyond compare. Our commitment to you, the owner, our guest, our community is unquestionable. 

We believe a happy home is a filled home so if you have a property that is not happy, please contact us to see how we can help you. 

Or if you're one of our amazing guests helping us, please let us know how we can make your stay more enjoyable.

I'm Joel, i'm born and raised in Sydney, which is in my opinion one of the most beautiful major cities in the world. My goal in life is to one day visit every country in the world, I hold no bias to any of them and hope that I get the opportunity. So far I have visited 42 countries. Last year I spent 1 year travelling in South and Central America and loved the opportunity I had to learn Spanish. It was a great experience and one that I will never forget. 

My hobbies include all forms of board sports, skating, surfing and snowboarding primarily. I enjoy learning about new cultures especially their foods. I grew up in an Italian restaurant so my love for food and cooking is deeply engrained in my personality. 

My style of hosting and living life in general is pretty relaxed. I will do my best to greet you at the door and make your stay as enjoyable as possible. But if you just want to chill I can totally relate. 

I also love music and watching live music. I mostly go out to see House, deep house and techno music as that scene in Sydney is easily accessible. However at home you will find me listening to hip-hop, reggae, latin, afro-beat, jazz and anything with a smooth and funky beat. 

If you need recommendations about food or music in Sydney these are probably my two strongest topics, so please don't hesitate. 

Looking forward to meeting more crazy, fun and cool people through Airbnb.

I am happy to say that I come from the melting pot of creation.  My genealogy is sourced from British, Scottish, Irish, French, Spanish, German and Indian blood.  As such I am a lover of all cultures. I was born in India and lived there for 15 years prior to migrating to Australia with parents, grandparents and 5 siblings.  I have two sisters and three brothers.

When it comes to food I love Indian curries having been nurtured by my late maternal grandmother who was of French and Indian stock.  These curries were particularly unique, developed over two centuries of what we call Anglo-Indian culture.  Yet I also enjoy the rich heritage of Anglo European cuisine which I have inherited from both sides of my family.
You get the picture - I love food and I like nothing more than cooking for other people.
I have travelled too - North America, Canada, England, Paris, Latvia, India, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, China, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. I have also briefly spent time in Vanuatu and Fiji and while the weather and activities were great they have not drawn me back. My home country of course tops the list especially as I still have a home there.  But Latvia in summer and Lake Toba in Sumatra have been the pearls of my journeys.

But it is hard to say I really like one thing/culture/place more than the other.  My home in Bindi is the place I go to when I want to wind down from my work in the Intellectual Disability sector.  At Bindi I find peace of mind and can settle down with my children to play scrabble, boggle and jigsaw puzzles.  At other times I can relax by doing some work on the property.  With three acres there is lots to do. On cooler days I go hiking into the forest or four wheel driving.  Occasionally I ride the dirt bike into the nearby hills.  At other times I drop a line in the river for a trout or go for a swim.  Though I must say my daughters have always caught the bigger fish.  Then there are great reads by Wilbur Smith and Bill Bryson just to name a couple.

I love live theatre, opera, musicals and comedy.  One of the more recent productions I enjoyed was Chinese Opera about the three kingdoms and I watched this in Chengdu, Sichuan, China in August 2016. Other musicals that I have loved are Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables but the production of Lion King did not meet my expectations.  I like music from the 50's to the 80's as well as Classical.  So if you decide to visit Bindi for an AirBnB stay you will find quite a selection.  Just to name a few performers - BB King, U2, Dire Straits, Crowded House, Men at Work, Michael Buble, Brahms, Beethoven and so on.

Sadly, as much as I would like to be there all the time to host my guests my work with people with a disability is my passion.  It is not just a career, it is a vocation in which I plan to spend the rest of my life.

However, I do get to Bindi every 2nd weekend and it would be a pleasure to host and to show you the pleasures that the local area has to offer.

As such I am offering people the opportunity to enjoy what I have to share with or without my presence and to make themselves at home.  What I do ask is that you treat the opportunity to rest and recuperate in a pristine setting with as much respect as you give your own home and family.

Formerly I was an engineer and believed that life was very structured and controlled.  I did that for 19 years and one day felt I needed a change.  After another 22 years working with people with a disability I have grown in the knowledge that life cannot be controlled but can be enjoyed.

My catchcry now is ""There is no such thing as a disability because we are all differently able"". I know this well, having experienced a minor disability in 1985 losing three fingers in an industrial accident. I believe that ""if you can dream it you can do it"".",60

I'm Joel, i'm born and raised in Sydney, which is in my opinion one of the most beautiful major cities in the world. My goal in life is to one day visit every country in the world, I hold no bias to any of them and hope that I get the opportunity. So far I have visited 42 countries. Last year I spent 1 year travelling in South and Central America and loved the opportunity I had to learn Spanish. It was a great experience and one that I will never forget. 

My hobbies include all forms of board sports, skating, surfing and snowboarding primarily. I enjoy learning about new cultures especially their foods. I grew up in an Italian restaurant so my love for food and cooking is deeply engrained in my personality. 

My style of hosting and living life in general is pretty relaxed. I will do my best to greet you at the door and make your stay as enjoyable as possible. But if you just want to chill I can totally relate. 

I also love music and watching live music. I mostly go out to see House, deep house and techno music as that scene in Sydney is easily accessible. However at home you will find me listening to hip-hop, reggae, latin, afro-beat, jazz and anything with a smooth and funky beat. 

If you need recommendations about food or music in Sydney these are probably my two strongest topics, so please don't hesitate. 

Looking forward to meeting more crazy, fun and cool people through Airbnb.

I live life with drive and purpose and always strive to achieve amazing lifestyle options.

I am passionate home renovator, and I enjoy creating beautiful spaces in special locations. I have been lovingly (and sometimes no so lovingly) restoring and building during my spare time and Im pretty happy with the results.  One of my favourite pastimes is shopping in second hand junk and antique shops and using old authentic treasures I find to create great spaces.

I run my own business and although I am constantly busy, I love to entertain and I relax with good food and usually too much wine!

Im am originally from the UK and have been an Aussie citizen for 21 years now. I consider myself blessed to have the opportunity to create a happy, comfortable lifestyle and am delighted to be able to share it with other like minded travellers.

When you stay in my house I’m hoping you will see and feel the attention to detail and the love that has gone into creating the living spaces and I sincerely hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",750

At my place guests will experience the unique Melbourne home design and our style of living, so that it will remains in their memories forever. And this is the gift I like to bring for my guests. 
As a guest, what could be worst then arriving at the Airbnb and find that the host has cancelled your booking! Your previous time which can be used to explore the city is now spend calling Airbnb and fanatically looking for another accommodation. You may even ended up blowing your travel budget because what's available in the last minute is higher than what you originally booked.

Alongside the delightful scenery we are also situated near the hospital and university, conveniently with a bus stop right beside our driveway that takes you straight into Frankston’s CBD.
We have a fully furnished bedroom that consists of a queen size bed, build in wardrobe and a television with access to Stan and Netflix, we also have a collection of dvds for your enjoyment. Our main bathroom is privately yours to use alongside a seperate toilet just outside the door of your bedroom. 
Downstairs we have an open plan living area featuring a 8x4 pool table connecting to a spacious kitchen. Open to greenery and sunlight is the floor to ceiling bifold door opening to the decking with an outdoor setting and bbq space to entertain, relax and enjoy.

Our laundry is yours also to use when required with both a washer and dryer. We have a second refrigerator also in the laundry for your use.

James and I have fur babies, a dog and cat. Both have grown together and also are very loving towards others. They insist on saying hello to houseguests but understand your need for privacy keeping close to mum and dad. 
It is necessary that you are accepting of our pets as they are of you because this is also their home. We appreciate that only those who respect that chose to stay. 

James and I work sometimes varied hours but are always home of an evening and sometimes throughout the day.

We hope some travellers can find our place accommodating.
We can offer stays for one night to multiple weeks.

I'm a 20 years old undergraduate student currently studying commercial law. I like to watch movies and play video games. Sometimes I could spend my whole day in my room just play games. I thought that there isn't much things to do outside and I thought the World was a boring place. When I'm not playing games, I would read news on the internet just to catch up with the rest of the world. That's how I knew Airbnb. 

One day, my father come to me, talked about doing short term renting. He has got few new apartments that our relatives bought which needs to be rented out. I told him about Airbnb and he thought we could really make it work. So I asked my best friend if he is interested to be my partner for this, and he said yes. We started almost immediately, planning, buying furnitures to started taking guests in just two weeks. 

Then it really changed me.

I met with travellers around the world. Every body was so polite and friendly.  When I talk to them I can feel the excitement and happiness. It's totally  different compare to what I thought people are like. Maybe because this communicate is great, I don't know.  Then I  thought ""I want to be people like my guests"". I want people around me to feel life is great and there are a lot to look forward to. The guests really gave me a lot motivation towards my work and my life. Here I have to thank you all.

After one month, the revenue was great, however take away the interests and loans, all kinds of fees and salary for my partner, there are really not much left for me. But I think that's enough, I'm still a student, I have to spend time on study and don't have much things to spend money on anyway, being able to save money for a holiday with my girl friend every few month is perfect for me. 

After all these experience, I felt it really changed my life and how I view the world. Doesn't matter if I fail or succeed it's  going to effect the rest of my life in a very positive way, that's something really valuable to me.",119

I started StayCentral when I purchased one apartment in 2005, and now manage multiple properties in many different locations in inner Melbourne.

Like many of my guests, I love to travel; both overseas on epic journeys (including remote locations like the Mulu Caves in Borneo, ancient cities (in Nepal, Turkey, Peru & Jordan), Antarctica & Alaska, Torres del Paine and colourful markets in amazing places like Fa Long in Vietnam, Jaisalmer in India, & La Paz in Bolivia). I also love short domestic trips for weekends away just to relax. It means I get to be on the other side of the counter, and experience how other people look after their guests: and I take their good ideas back with me. 

(My manager, Max, has also travelled from afar to be here btw, and he can also speak with our guests in Russian and Ukranian).

I even worked as a part-time tourist guide in Melbourne for a couple of years, and really enjoyed the interactions with the tourists off the huge cruise liners that appear in Melbourne each spring and summer. I have tried to extend this experience into my accommodation business here at home, where I really love assisting people with their stays. You only need to read the 550 or so reviews on Airbnb, Trip advisor, Goo gle, and on my own StayCentral website to realise how much our guests enjoy our apartments, and the way we look after them. 

I like keeping fit with gym work and roller-blading; often blading 30 kms or so on a day out. I cook for my mates once a month, and have done so since 2007. I cook and they bring the wine; my other love since coming to Melbourne in 2003.

I love living in Melbourne. It enjoys a unique place in Australia. It is often described as the cultural, business, shopping and sporting capital of the country. The restaurants and cafes in Melbourne are amongst the best in the world. I love living in an urban village amongst these, and all the other everyday shops; and jumping on a tram and avoiding the hassles of traffic. It is a city of great opportunity, experiences, events and lifestyle that can be enjoyed by locals and visitors alike; and I really enjoy facilitating our guests' stays here.

StayCentral Melbourne Corporate Apartments is a unique group of serviced apartments in central Melbourne. We offer boutique short and long-stay accommodation for relocations, family holidays and getaways. Our comfortable apartments have also been enjoyed by employees and contractors, executives and people needing temporary accommodation. We even have many pet-friendly apartments available! We provide excellent customer service from the time you first contact us to make a booking, through to the end of your stay.

All of our properties from one-bedroom apartments to seven-bedroom mansions are close to all the everyday things our guests would need during their stay; from cafes, restaurants and supermarkets, to shops, trams and nightlife - yet all locations are generally very quiet.

All of our interiors have been designed by experienced interior designers, and you will experience that feeling of ""I'm home!"" when you walk in, make yourself a cuppa and put your feet up. We supply far more than tea and coffee etc. There are many extras that make your stay more pleasant for our guests; including shopping trolleys, free Netflix in most properties, umbrellas and book exchanges.

I do hope I have the opportunity to help you get to know Melbourne and grow to love it as I have.",255

We love being airbnb hosts and sharing our homes and our beautiful city with others.
We have been airbnb hosts for over four years and during that time we have met amazing and wonderful people from all around Australia and all parts of the world.
We started with the spare room in our own home and now have 20 properties, from high end luxury to family friendly apartments that we offer our guests. We even have a 7 bedroom, 7 bathroom mansion near the sea in St Kilda for larger groups! 
We use airbnb ourselves whenever we travel and feel we know what people are looking for. Good value, great locations, clean, comfortable and friendly! All our properties are in great locations, are professionally cleaned and we use hotel quality, commercially laundered linen on comfortable beds.  We meet all our guests on arrival to say hello and are on hand to offer help, advice and inside tips of places to go and things to see. 
Most of our properties include free parking which is a real bonus in the city and Foxtel (cable) television and other homely touches so you 'can live like a local'. (You can view our properties by clicking the View Full Profile link below and clicking on the listings on the left hand side of the page). 

A little bit about ourselves ... we're pretty easy going, and love getting out and about exploring different places. We are both keen travellers and have done our fair share of it in Australia and overseas - whether backpacking, camping, or an occasional splurge on 5-star resorts! You wouldn't call us 'party animals', but we do like socialising and meeting people.  We enjoy a wide variety of interests, love the movies, eating out, popping down to the beach on our scooter or pushbikes, and enjoying the many exciting sporting events and festivals that Melbourne has to offer.
Our motto is ""strangers are just friends you haven't met yet!""
Wishing you happy travels and looking forward to meeting you soon :-)

Best regards

What I love the most about living in Melbourne is that Melbourne is a multicultural city where you can enjoy variety of foods, street arts and nature.

Both myself and my co-host Simon (both Airbnb Superhosts) have been hosting for more than 5 years. We will do our best to make sure you enjoy your stay with us! Our reviews speak for themselves!

Why book with Superhost?
First what is a superhost? https://www.airbnb.com/superhost

As a guest, what could be worst then arriving at the Airbnb and find that the host has cancelled your booking! Your previous time which can be used to explore the city is now spend calling Airbnb and fanatically looking for another accommodation. You may even ended up blowing your travel  budget because what's available in the last minute is higher than what you originally booked.

This is a one-be","A mining engineer by profession, I have owned two other service businesses since 1998. I started StayCentral when I purchased one apartment in 2005, and now manage multiple properties in many different locations in inner Melbourne.

Like many of my guests, I love to travel; both overseas on epic journeys (including remote locations like the Mulu Caves in Borneo, ancient cities (in Nepal, Turkey, Peru & Jordan), Antarctica & Alaska, Torres del Paine and colourful markets in amazing places like Fa Long in Vietnam, Jaisalmer in India, & La Paz in Bolivia). I also love short domestic trips for weekends away just to relax. It means I get to be on the other side of the counter, and experience how other people look after their guests: and I take their good ideas back with me. 

(My manager, Max, has also travelled from afar to be here btw, and he can also speak with our guests in Russian and Ukranian).

I even worked as a part-time tourist guide in Melbourne for a couple of years, and really enjoyed the interactions with the tourists off the huge cruise liners that appear in Melbourne each spring and summer. I have tried to extend this experience into my accommodation business here at home, where I really love assisting people with their stays. You only need to read the 550 or so reviews on Airbnb, Trip advisor, Goo gle, and on my own StayCentral website to realise how much our guests enjoy our apartments, and the way we look after them. 

I like keeping fit with gym work and roller-blading; often blading 30 kms or so on a day out. I cook for my mates once a month, and have done so since 2007. I cook and they bring the wine; my other love since coming to Melbourne in 2003.

I love living in Melbourne. It enjoys a unique place in Australia. It is often described as the cultural, business, shopping and sporting capital of the country. The restaurants and cafes in Melbourne are amongst the best in the world. I love living in an urban village amongst these, and all the other everyday shops; and jumping on a tram and avoiding the hassles of traffic. It is a city of great opportunity, experiences, events and lifestyle that can be enjoyed by locals and visitors alike; and I really enjoy facilitating our guests' stays here.

StayCentral Melbourne Corporate Apartments is a unique group of serviced apartments in central Melbourne. We offer boutique short and long-stay accommodation for relocations, family holidays and getaways. Our comfortable apartments have also been enjoyed by employees and contractors, executives and people needing temporary accommodation. We even have many pet-friendly apartments available! We provide excellent customer service from the time you first contact us to make a booking, through to the end of your stay.

All of our properties from one-bedroom apartments to seven-bedroom mansions are close to all the everyday things our guests would need during their stay; from cafes, restaurants and supermarkets, to shops, trams and nightlife - yet all locations are generally very quiet.

All of our interiors have been designed by experienced interior designers, and you will experience that feeling of ""I'm home!"" when you walk in, make yourself a cuppa and put your feet up. We supply far more than tea and coffee etc. There are many extras that make your stay more pleasant for our guests; including shopping trolleys, free Netflix in most properties, umbrellas and book exchanges.

I'm Joel, i'm born and raised in Sydney, which is in my opinion one of the most beautiful major cities in the world. My goal in life is to one day visit every country in the world, I hold no bias to any of them and hope that I get the opportunity. So far I have visited 42 countries. Last year I spent 1 year travelling in South and Central America and loved the opportunity I had to learn Spanish. It was a great experience and one that I will never forget. 

My hobbies include all forms of board sports, skating, surfing and snowboarding primarily. I enjoy learning about new cultures especially their foods. I grew up in an Italian restaurant so my love for food and cooking is deeply engrained in my personality. 

My style of hosting and living life in general is pretty relaxed. I will do my best to greet you at the door and make your stay as enjoyable as possible. But if you just want to chill I can totally relate. 

I also love music and watching live music. I mostly go out to see House, deep house and techno music as that scene in Sydney is easily accessible. However at home you will find me listening to hip-hop, reggae, latin, afro-beat, jazz and anything with a smooth and funky beat. 

If you need recommendations about food or music in Sydney these are probably my two strongest topics, so please don't hesitate.

If you book with me you'll be communicating with both myself and my staff.

I’m an entrepreneur, architecture graduate, photographer, cyclist (NOT the lycra kind), volunteer, adventurer and problem solver.

During my studies I worked at various cafes and architecture offices to save up for shoestring trips around the world. My grandma once told me I had ‘champagne taste but a beer budget’ and it’s a motto I’ve enjoyed applying to different parts of my life to get the more out of less and find enjoyment in the little things.

I love discovering authentic experiences when I travel and I love being able to share the opportunity with others, to live like a local when they travel too.

Some of my most memorable trips have been couch-surfin across Russia while taking the Trans Siberian, living in Helsinki and learning to hand build furniture, riding a vintage steel bicycle through France to race in L’Eroica and buying a car on craigzlist in Los Angeles and driving across the south, east and north coasts to arrive in Vancouver.

My listings are all managed by Beyond a Room and are all given names that I think reflect the character of the property and area. My aim is to give guests a unique and local perspective on the location and share my knowledge and experience of this wonderful city with travellers so that they feel at home. Search Beyond a Room to find out more about how we can help manage your airbnb.

Both myself and my co-host Simon (both Airbnb Superhosts) have been hosting for more than 5 years. We will do our best to make sure you enjoy your stay with us! Our reviews speak for themselves!

Also have a look at my Airbnb guidebook where I listed some of the highlights of Melborne. Also I have a 'secret' list of my favorite foods specially prepared just for my guests! ;)

Why book with Superhost?
First what is a superhost? https://www.airbnb.com/superhost

As a guest, what could be worst then arriving at the Airbnb and find that the host has cancelled your booking! Your previous time which can be used to explore the city is now spend calling Airbnb and fanatically looking for another accommodation. You may even ended up blowing your travel  budget because what's available in the last minute is higher than what you originally booked.

Booking with Superhost means you peace of mind and much lesser chance of having your booking cancelled.",150

My wife Stacey and I have some amazing places in Melbourne and the Yarra Valley that we'd love to share with you. 

We have a stunning (circa 1854) converted stables in St Kilda, which is very close to Fitzroy and Acland Streets, the beach and many awesome cafes and restaurants and the Albert Park Formula One circuit. We have two stunning Art Deco apartments in the Botanic Garden’s precinct in Melbourne, which are close to the best of everything that Melbourne is famous for – shopping with Chapel St (South Yarra), Toorak Rd (South Yarra) & Bridge Rd (Richmond) all within walking distance to the best sports grounds in Australia including the MCG, Australian Open Tennis Arena, Melbourne Formula 1 Grand Prix and CBD all within 2 klms. South Yarra and the CBD have many of the best bars and restaurants and in typical Melbourne style you’ll have to scour the backstreets and laneways to find them.

Healesville Country House is our beautiful 5 bedroom home in the Yarra Valley, it is a former guesthouse circa 1900 that we've lovingly restored and created a family home from. We are two minutes from the main street and 5-10 minutes from some of the world's best wineries. It is the perfect place for unwinding with plenty of outdoor spaces including a pool and verandahs boasting some of the best views around.

Check out our profile for additional information and pictures. We're really happy to recommend our favourite restaurants, cafes and places to see. 
  
About us - I’m work with the best and brightest Australian technology and digital start-ups to help them become successful through investment and mentoring. Stacey is in the Fashion Industry and travels the world promoting emerging Australian brands to the rest of the world. We love everything about Melbourne, meeting new people, and travelling as much as we can – we are now eager to use AirBNB for all of our trips and hope to meet some of you through the process.",161

I am a musician and engineer and interested in finding solutions to climate change.

In my music work, I love singing, playing bass and performing. I do everything from performing at weddings, to parties, to busking (which I love).

I enjoy traveling  and exploring cities of the world, whether in Australia or overseas (Europe especially beguiling - London, Paris, Berlin). 

I am into sustainability, pretty relaxed and easygoing, don't smoke, and enjoy meeting up with friends for coffee and films  :)

Also, I have many interests, and tend to go out a lot of the time, rather than being house-bound.

I'm a 20 years old undergraduate student currently studying commercial law. I like to watch movies and play video games. Sometimes I could spend my whole day in my room just play games. I thought that there isn't much things to do outside and I thought the World was a boring place. When I'm not playing games, I would read news on the internet just to catch up with the rest of the world. That's how I knew Airbnb. 

One day, my father come to me, talked about doing short term renting. He has got few new apartments that our relatives bought which needs to be rented out. I told him about Airbnb and he thought we could really make it work. So I asked my best friend if he is interested to be my partner for this, and he said yes. We started almost immediately, planning, buying furnitures to started taking guests in just two weeks. 

Then it really changed me.

I met with travellers around the world. Every body was so polite and friendly.  When I talk to them I can feel the excitement and happiness. It's totally  different compare to what I thought people are like. Maybe because this communicate is great, I don't know.  Then I  thought ""I want to be people like my guests"". I want people around me to feel life is great and there are a lot to look forward to. The guests really gave me a lot motivation towards my work and my life. Here I have to thank you all.

After one month, the revenue was great, however take away the interests and loans, all kinds of fees and salary for my partner, there are really not much left for me. But I think that's enough, I'm still a student, I have to spend time on study and don't have much things to spend money on anyway, being able to save money for a holiday with my girl friend every few month is perfect for me. 

After all these experience, I felt it really changed my life and how I view the world. Doesn't matter if I fail or succeed it's  going to effect the rest of my life in a very positive way, that's something really valuable to me.",170

I'm Joel, i'm born and raised in Sydney, which is in my opinion one of the most beautiful major cities in the world. My goal in life is to one day visit every country in the world, I hold no bias to any of them and hope that I get the opportunity. So far I have visited 42 countries. Last year I spent 1 year travelling in South and Central America and loved the opportunity I had to learn Spanish. It was a great experience and one that I will never forget. 

My hobbies include all forms of board sports, skating, surfing and snowboarding primarily. I enjoy learning about new cultures especially their foods. I grew up in an Italian restaurant so my love for food and cooking is deeply engrained in my personality. 

My style of hosting and living life in general is pretty relaxed. I will do my best to greet you at the door and make your stay as enjoyable as possible. But if you just want to chill I can totally relate. 

I also love music and watching live music. I mostly go out to see House, deep house and techno music as that scene in Sydney is easily accessible. However at home you will find me listening to hip-hop, reggae, latin, afro-beat, jazz and anything with a smooth and funky beat. 

If you need recommendations about food or music in Sydney these are probably my two strongest topics, so please don't hesitate. 

Looking forward to meeting more crazy, fun and cool people through Airbnb.

Airbnb is awesome. I've used it travelling around the world and it such a great way to meet people and live like a local. Hope you find the place you are looking for. 

Any questions on anything, please let me know.

I'm Joel, i'm born and raised in Sydney, which is in my opinion one of the most beautiful major cities in the world. My goal in life is to one day visit every country in the world, I hold no bias to any of them and hope that I get the opportunity. So far I have visited 42 countries. Last year I spent 1 year travelling in South and Central America and loved the opportunity I had to learn Spanish. It was a great experience and one that I will never forget. 

My hobbies include all forms of board sports, skating, surfing and snowboarding primarily. I enjoy learning about new cultures especially their foods. I grew up in an Italian restaurant so my love for food and cooking is deeply engrained in my personality. 

My style of hosting and living life in general is pretty relaxed. I will do my best to greet you at the door and make your stay as enjoyable as possible. But if you just want to chill I can totally relate. 

I also love music and watching live music. I mostly go out to see House, deep house and techno music as that scene in Sydney is easily accessible. However at home you will find me listening to hip-hop, reggae, latin, afro-beat, jazz and anything with a smooth and funky beat. 

If you need recommendations about food or music in Sydney these are probably my two strongest topics, so please don't hesitate.

Being a Airbnb host for 5-6 years. I love being a host, because I know that when people, different group of people and family come to our place, when they feel, it is worth it. I love it and enjoy. That's the happiness that other job may not able to find it. I really love to see when my guests they start to step to the apartment and feel wow and impressed.
Honestly, being a host, it is not easy decision.
We have to make sure every details things in our place are the best to our guests. 
From check-in to check-out. It is an experience not only for guests. it is for us as well. It is the whole responsibilities. 

That’s what I think, the reason which motivates me to be a host.

Melbourne is a very multi-cultural city 
My objective is, if someone come here they should be connected to the right place.
Me, as a host, I think is kind of connecting these different piece together, a kind of connection.
The high point of my stay was how you made me feel. And how you made me feel, it sticks. It sticks with you.”
I have the traditional way to believe.
We believe it is the relationship that provide to the guests they will enjoy,  love the place to stay.
They trust me and I trust them. And that’s the reason it works.
So hospitalities if you ask me, is about care. It s about welcoming. This is about welcoming with open heart.  Welcome you to my Melbourne Apartment.",239

My husband was also born overseas - in Bucharest, Romania.  
After escaping the former communist regime, he lived in both Germany and France before finally settling in Australia in his early 20's.

You can expect open communication throughout but we will always respect your privacy and allow you to enjoy your stay.

We love being airbnb hosts and sharing our homes and our beautiful city with others.
We have been airbnb hosts for over four years and during that time we have met amazing and wonderful people from all around Australia and all parts of the world.
We started with the spare room in our own home and now have 20 properties, from high end luxury to family friendly apartments that we offer our guests. We even have a 7 bedroom, 7 bathroom mansion near the sea in St Kilda for larger groups! 
We use airbnb ourselves whenever we travel and feel we know what people are looking for. Good value, great locations, clean, comfortable and friendly! All our properties are in great locations, are professionally cleaned and we use hotel quality, commercially laundered linen on comfortable beds.  We meet all our guests on arrival to say hello and are on hand to offer help, advice and inside tips of places to go and things to see. 
Most of our properties include free parking which is a real bonus in the city and Foxtel (cable) television and other homely touches so you 'can live like a local'. (You can view our properties by clicking the View Full Profile link below and clicking on the listings on the left hand side of the page). 

A little bit about ourselves ... we're pretty easy going, and love getting out and about exploring different places. We are both keen travellers and have done our fair share of it in Australia and overseas - whether backpacking, camping, or an occasional splurge on 5-star resorts! You wouldn't call us 'party animals', but we do like socialising and meeting people.  We enjoy a wide variety of interests, love the movies, eating out, popping down to the beach on our scooter or pushbikes, and enjoying the many exciting sporting events and festivals that Melbourne has to offer.
Our motto is ""strangers are just friends you haven't met yet!""
Wishing you happy travels and looking forward to meeting you soon :-)

Approximately 10% of all my airbnb fee's go to Kiva to help reduce poverty and enable some of the poorest, hard working people in the world.  Check them out on the web.  I'll be happy to link with you personally on this if you would like to know more.  More below if you are interested.

I love where I live, the neighbourhood, good restaurants are plenty as well as Hot Yoga and Pilates and lots of delightful walks to take through the surrounding parks. The antics of my animals keeps me amused around the house.  

My most recent travel destination was a hike to Mt Everest Base camp with my wonderful son who is traveling the globe again at the moment.

I've had some delightful guests to host - all just wonderful, decent and interesting people from all walks of life.  I like my guests to settle in and feel comfortable and at home.

I'm a professional person in the IT industry and lead a pretty hectic lifestyle, but look forward to meeting some wonderful people who I might visit in return around the globe.

I like to keep fit and am getting back into my fitness, pilates classes and enjoy hot yoga. :)  

I've ticked ""German"" below as I do speak a little.  My grammar is often amusing though .... apparently!

Hope to host you soon and enjoy a chat.  Cheers N..

Now about Kiva....

A non-profit organization with a mission to connect people through lending to alleviate poverty. Leveraging the internet and a worldwide network of microfinance institutions, Kiva lets individuals lend as little as $25 to help create opportunity around the world. Learn more about how it works.

Since Kiva was founded in (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) :

They have over 1.2 million Kiva lenders
$ (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) in loans (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) % repayment rate

Why Kiva ..

We envision a world where all people - even in the most remote areas of the globe - hold the power to create opportunity for themselves and others.

We believe providing safe, affordable access to capital to those in need helps people create better lives for themselves and their families.

How we do it

Making a loan on Kiva is so simple that you may not realize how much work goes on behind the scenes.

Kiva works with microfinance institutions on five continents to provide loans to people without access to traditional banking systems. One hundred percent of your loan is sent to these microfinance institutions, which we call Field Partners, who administer the loans in the field.

My goal is to help investors increase their rental yields so they can shorten their time frames with future investing and/or achieving personal goals. 

Apart from the love of real-estate, I also love to travel. When travelling I like to have a mix of hitting popular tourist attractions as well as experiencing the ""live like a local"" feel and really experience the culture of my chosen destination. 

Some of my favourite places  to visit are New York, Majorca, Lisbon, Positano, Greek Islands, Rome, New Zealand in a camper van and many more. I usually like to chase the sun but I also love snowboarding and like to keep active and fit. 

As a traveler I like the simplicity of self check-in so as a host I aim to automate this process as much as possible so you as the guest can simply get to your destination with no delays. 

In my travels I have found that getting some local knowledge can be very helpful so I will provide some tips and guides of things to do to get you started.

Wanderlust has previously lured us to Europe, the Americas, Asia, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific, Africa and Outback Australia.

When in Sandringham, we make the most of long Bayside walks on beachside tracks both summer and winter, outdoor BBQ's and swims in the clear bay water of Sandringham beach when the weather is warmer.
We enjoy the relaxed, peaceful atmosphere that Sandringham offers.  A short stroll leads to one of our many favourite cafes for coffee and breakfast, or later for dinner.  
Catching the train nearby, we may head to Brighton or Windsor for a movie, Ripponlea to `Attica' (one of the World's Top 50 restaurants), Elsternwick or Richmond for live music, or Melbourne city for a gallery or live show. For all St Kilda has to offer, including Melbourne's very own Fairy Penguin colony, the bus leaves from just minutes' away.

We love being airbnb hosts and sharing our homes and our beautiful city with others.
We have been airbnb hosts for over four years and during that time we have met amazing and wonderful people from all around Australia and all parts of the world.
We started with the spare room in our own home and now have 20 properties, from high end luxury to family friendly apartments that we offer our guests. We even have a 7 bedroom, 7 bathroom mansion near the sea in St Kilda for larger groups! 
We use airbnb ourselves whenever we travel and feel we know what people are looking for. Good value, great locations, clean, comfortable and friendly! All our properties are in great locations, are professionally cleaned and we use hotel quality, commercially laundered linen on comfortable beds.  We meet all our guests on arrival to say hello and are on hand to offer help, advice and inside tips of places to go and things to see. 
Most of our properties include free parking which is a real bonus in the city and Foxtel (cable) television and other homely touches so you 'can live like a local'. (You can view our properties by clicking the View Full Profile link below and clicking on the listings on the left hand side of the page). 

A little bit about ourselves ... we're pretty easy going, and love getting out and about exploring different places. We are both keen travellers and have done our fair share of it in Australia and overseas - whether backpacking, camping, or an occasional splurge on 5-star resorts! You wouldn't call us 'party animals', but we do like socialising and meeting people.  We enjoy a wide variety of interests, love the movies, eating out, popping down to the beach on our scooter or pushbikes, and enjoying the many exciting sporting events and festivals that Melbourne has to offer.
Our motto is ""strangers are just friends you haven't met yet!""
Wishing you happy travels and looking forward to meeting you soon :-)

Bronnie and Neil",125

We constantly find ourselves brainstorming of ways to improve what we can offer; whether its that extra bit of detail in restaurant picks, to arrival tips, to fine-tuning our description so anyone new can understand why we love where we live. We also hope of course that guest see we care about ensuring their stay is as enjoyable as they can expect.

We think our style is a reflection of our own travel experiences which has been extensive and at times hectic. With that, our hosting style is one where we are non-intrusive, but always respond within minutes by phone or SMS. A solution to your needs is really only a phone or SMS away.

We actually enjoy being asked for recommendations, from the ideal travel route, to activities for kids, to restaurant and cafe choices. We only ever recommend places we know and not what we can search for. As such we are shamelessly biased to South Yarra area when it comes to cafes and restaurants! So if you are indeed interested to book with us, ask us for tips, before or even during your stay.

I like to give people the warmth of feeling of being home but also a wow factor as they enter the place. And most importantly they feel it is worth their money! At my place guests will experience the unique Melbourne home design and our style of living, so that it will remains in their memories forever. And this is the gift I like to bring for my guests. 
As a guest, what could be worst then arriving at the Airbnb and find that the host has cancelled your booking! Your previous time which can be used to explore the city is now spend calling Airbnb and fanatically looking for another accommodation. You may even ended up blowing your travel budget because what's available in the last minute is higher than what you originally booked.

Booking with me means you will have a peace of mind and much lesser chance of having your booking cancelled.",100

We offer fully furnished, centrally located properties with plenty of parking and quality fixtures and furnishings, each has an alfresco entertainment area and BBQ in a garden setting, a fully equipped property in an exclusive professional apartment house environment, where new arrivals, to Melbourne, or people going through a lifestyle transition, can experience an instant community atmosphere for medium (from two weeks), or long term stays, and say goodbye to lonely, restrictive and expensive apartment living.

No more solitary TV dinners! Each property provides apartment house accommodation on a room-by-room basis with shared kitchen, dining and lounge facilities. This style of apartment house living provides opportunities for new arrivals, to Melbourne to quickly, form friendships, build networks with other likeminded people and settle more easily into a new life. This helps to alleviate homesickness and improves their effectiveness in the workplace or place of learning.

A safe and comfortable home life makes for a happier Melbourne experience.

I'm Joel, i'm born and raised in Sydney, which is in my opinion one of the most beautiful major cities in the world. My goal in life is to one day visit every country in the world, I hold no bias to any of them and hope that I get the opportunity. So far I have visited 42 countries. Last year I spent 1 year travelling in South and Central America and loved the opportunity I had to learn Spanish. It was a great experience and one that I will never forget. 

My hobbies include all forms of board sports, skating, surfing and snowboarding primarily. I enjoy learning about new cultures especially their foods. I grew up in an Italian restaurant so my love for food and cooking is deeply engrained in my personality. 

My style of hosting and living life in general is pretty relaxed. I will do my best to greet you at the door and make your stay as enjoyable as possible. But if you just want to chill I can totally relate. 

I also love music and watching live music. I mostly go out to see House, deep house and techno music as that scene in Sydney is easily accessible. However at home you will find me listening to hip-hop, reggae, latin, afro-beat, jazz and anything with a smooth and funky beat. 

If you need recommendations about food or music in Sydney these are probably my two strongest topics, so please don't hesitate. 

Looking forward to meeting more crazy, fun and cool people through Airbnb.

I'm married with two kids, currently sporting a 4 month old baby and 3 year old girl.  We live in Fitzroy in Melbourne, in a charming single story terrace. I love tinkering around the house, cooking, flowers, and gardening. (mind you I don't get much time for this given my new status as mother of two!) 

Fav things include watching cartoons, going to art galleries (installation art a fav)  drinking good coffee, going for walks through gardens, swimming at every opportunity, reading good books, having dinner parties and talking till all hours of the morning (though since kids that's become kind of a challenge.) I love hanging out with my family and laughing and mucking about cracking jokes.  I love my friends and giggling with them.  

I love laughing, jokes, comedy, and think life is far too important to be taken seriously. I'm incredibly grateful to be healthy and have a healthy little family.",270

I'm Jonathan, I'm in my mid 40's, sometimes older sometimes younger and I love to travel. 

In terms of a home I love a comfy couch, I love a deep bath and I love full blockout curtains. 

5 things I can't live without?

Books, I love a good book.
Good food. I love sharing a great meal with others.
Long sleep in's on Sundays or any day really.
Water. I love swimming in the ocean or rivers. Lets keep them clean.
Music. Anything from opera to house.

As your host, I will be on call to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If anything goes wrong during your stay, say the washing machine won't start or something, I will have it sorted immediately. I've had guest stay at my place for 3 month and then extend up to 16 months. I've had guests who moved out and then told me if they could stay forever they would be very happy. 

As someone who has travelled a lot with work and stayed in hotels motels and apartments both long and short term, I set out to create a space that was a real home away from home. Somewhere where you can feel safe, warm and cosy and enjoy a good home cooked meal. It was all about atmosphere. A deep bath to relax in, comfy couches to put your feet up on, a big TV to tune out to and stunning view whilst enjoying your breakfast. In winter turn on the gas log fireplace and enjoy a glass of wine. Head out to one of the many great eating establishments on Chapel St, Fitzroy St or take a tram to the city. the tram stop is a 2 minute walk away.

Everyone who has stayed at Charnwood has enjoyed their stay. I'm sure you will too. Great location, affordably priced and in a very convenient but quiet street.",89

I'm a 20 years old undergraduate student currently studying commercial law. I like to watch movies and play video games. Sometimes I could spend my whole day in my room just play games. I thought that there isn't much things to do outside and I thought the World was a boring place. When I'm not playing games, I would read news on the internet just to catch up with the rest of the world. That's how I knew Airbnb. 

One day, my father come to me, talked about doing short term renting. He has got few new apartments that our relatives bought which needs to be rented out. I told him about Airbnb and he thought we could really make it work. So I asked my best friend if he is interested to be my partner for this, and he said yes. We started almost immediately, planning, buying furnitures to started taking guests in just two weeks. 

Then it really changed me.

I met with travellers around the world. Every body was so polite and friendly.  When I talk to them I can feel the excitement and happiness. It's totally  different compare to what I thought people are like. Maybe because this communicate is great, I don't know.  Then I  thought ""I want to be people like my guests"". I want people around me to feel life is great and there are a lot to look forward to. The guests really gave me a lot motivation towards my work and my life. Here I have to thank you all.

After one month, the revenue was great, however take away the interests and loans, all kinds of fees and salary for my partner, there are really not much left for me. But I think that's enough, I'm still a student, I have to spend time on study and don't have much things to spend money on anyway, being able to save money for a holiday with my girl friend every few month is perfect for me. 

After all these experience, I felt it really changed my life and how I view the world. Doesn't matter if I fail or succeed it's  going to effect the rest of my life in a very positive way, that's something really valuable to me.",143

Hi there, we have lived in Melbourne most of our lives. We have raised a family, are running our own businesses and love to travel when we can.  We hope to facilitate a wonderful experience for people staying in our property, just as others have done for us when we have been overseas. We always aim to meet our guests on arrival and to relate to people in a respectful and friendly way.

Our travel experiences in the last 10 years have included all states in Australia, Europe, UK, South Africa, Canada and Alaska. Many years ago before having a family we also travelled around China and South East Asia and would love to revisit these regions. In our travels we have been most captivated by fabulous scenery and by the amazing people we have met, whether it be fellow travellers or lovely locals who we have connected with. 

Peter has been an electrician for more than 40 years and has a great passion for Australian Rules football and playing golf with good friends. Marianne is a psychologist and loves to read, catch up with friends over a coffee and take our dogs for long walks. Occasionally our daughter Jess will help you check in, she is working on a PhD and likes to take her eyes off a computer screen and help out when she can.

Melbourne is a wonderful city to visit, as it offers so much in cultural, sporting and dining experiences to discover. We’d be happy offer suggestions to help you to explore your interests while in Melbourne.

We have been hosts on Airbnb for a couple of years and have hosted friends and family for many more years, providing a warm, welcoming and relaxing experience. We welcome your inquiries about staying in Melbourne.

We look forward to meeting you.

Love exchanging travel stories, ideas and meeting people of different cultures. My purpose for traveling is to experience varying cultures, hopefully improve my tolerance, knowledge and grow as an individual from the experience and fortunate to have volunteered in Brazil and South Africa 

As a Host and guest, I appreciate what I would like to get out of using and hosting with Air BnB.

I will be very happy to sit down over a glass of wine to provide advise on what to see and do while in Melbourne , Australia and of course beautiful New Zealand! 
If guests want minimal interaction I am happy to leave them to their own devises and independence or interact as much as required.

I’m an entrepreneur, architecture graduate, photographer, cyclist (NOT the lycra kind), volunteer, adventurer and problem solver.

During my studies I worked at various cafes and architecture offices to save up for shoestring trips around the world. My grandma once told me I had ‘champagne taste but a beer budget’ and it’s a motto I’ve enjoyed applying to different parts of my life to get the more out of less and find enjoyment in the little things.

I love discovering authentic experiences when I travel and I love being able to share the opportunity with others, to live like a local when they travel too.

Some of my most memorable trips have been couch-surfin across Russia while taking the Trans Siberian, living in Helsinki and learning to hand build furniture, riding a vintage steel bicycle through France to race in L’Eroica and buying a car on craigzlist in Los Angeles and driving across the south, east and north coasts to arrive in Vancouver.

My listings are all managed by Beyond a Room and are all given names that I think reflect the character of the property and area. My aim is to give guests a unique and local perspective on the location and share my knowledge and experience of this wonderful city with travellers so that they feel at home.

I've only used AirBnb in the past to rent out my own space so am new to being on the other side! I'm originally from California and graduated from my master's course in Melbourne back in December. I've relocated to Perth to start a new life! I've been housesitting and taking care of people's pets for the past year and absolutely love it but am wanting to get back into a more 'grounded' routine, thus looking into AirBnb to situate something semi-permanent. In lieu of AirBnb reviews I have my own housesitting webpage profile with reviews from all of the families I've housesat for! Hoping it's a good indicator that if I can look after people's massive homes and special needs pets that I can take care of your home, too! I can give that link to you in a message as AirBnb doesn't seem to like me posting a link to another webpage on my profile :) I also have a fantastic reference from an AirBnB host in Fremantle.

Each mattress has a plush pillow top giving a luxurious comfort without the mattress feeling too hard or too soft. The 3-zone pocket spring system means you won't feel your partner tossing and turning all night and the double box walls mean you can sleep right up to the edge of the mattress without it caving in or losing comfort. 5-STAR LINEN AND TOWELS We provide 5-star hotel quality fresh linen and towels. Each guest is given a bath towel and face washer and the beds are made with two fresh sheets and a fresh cover on the quilt.

We love being airbnb hosts and sharing our homes and our beautiful city with others.
We have been airbnb hosts for over four years and during that time we have met amazing and wonderful people from all around Australia and all parts of the world.
We started with the spare room in our own home and now have 20 properties, from high end luxury to family friendly apartments that we offer our guests. We even have a 7 bedroom, 7 bathroom mansion near the sea in St Kilda for larger groups! 
We use airbnb ourselves whenever we travel and feel we know what people are looking for. Good value, great locations, clean, comfortable and friendly! All our properties are in great locations, are professionally cleaned and we use hotel quality, commercially laundered linen on comfortable beds.  We meet all our guests on arrival to say hello and are on hand to offer help, advice and inside tips of places to go and things to see. 
Most of our properties include free parking which is a real bonus in the city and Foxtel (cable) television and other homely touches so you 'can live like a local'. (You can view our properties by clicking the View Full Profile link below and clicking on the listings on the left hand side of the page). 

A little bit about ourselves ... we're pretty easy going, and love getting out and about exploring different places. We are both keen travellers and have done our fair share of it in Australia and overseas - whether backpacking, camping, or an occasional splurge on 5-star resorts! You wouldn't call us 'party animals', but we do like socialising and meeting people.  We enjoy a wide variety of interests, love the movies, eating out, popping down to the beach on our scooter or pushbikes, and enjoying the many exciting sporting events and festivals that Melbourne has to offer.
Our motto is ""strangers are just friends you haven't met yet!""
Wishing you happy travels and looking forward to meeting you soon :-)

- Malaysia – we indulged in so much street food.
- Singapore – more food!
- Japan – visited manga museums, awe-inspired by amazingly advanced technology, ate lots of raman ordered from vending machines
- France – I did a summer abroad in Angouleme in high school then in Vichy so try to go back whenever we get the chance!

Before I go into depth with my description, I will list the Pros and Cons (or FAQ) of the place based on the feedback I’ve received from guests over the last 3-4 years.  These are all listed in the main features but are sometimes missed by guests. PROS Location – Close to the city but not too close.  It’s in a quiet street opposite a block that is only occupied during business hours yet it’s only a 10-15 minute walk to the CBD and less than 10 minutes via tram.  It’s even closer to Melbourne icons such as the Shrine of Remembrance, Botanical Gardens, NGV and the Arts Centre. Proximity to Public Transport – A 2 minute walk to the nearest stop where 8 different tram lines will take you towards the CBD meaning you will rarely wait more than 2-3 minutes.  Trams heading in the opposite direction will take you to places such as St Kil","I'm a 38 year old male.

That's the happiness that other job may not able to find it. I really love to see when my guests they start to step to the apartment and feel wow and impressed.
Honestly, being a host, it is not easy decision.
We have to make sure every details things in our place are the best to our guests. 
From check-in to check-out. It is an experience not only for guests. it is for us as well. It is the whole responsibilities. 

That’s what I think, the reason which motivates me to be a host.

Melbourne is a very multi-cultural city 
My objective is, if someone come here they should be connected to the right place.
Me, as a host, I think is kind of connecting these different piece together, a kind of connection.
The high point of my stay was how you made me feel. And how you made me feel, it sticks. It sticks with you.”
I have the traditional way to believe.
We believe it is the relationship that provide to the guests they will enjoy,  love the place to stay.
They trust me and I trust them. And that’s the reason it works.
So hospitalities if you ask me, is about care. It s about welcoming. This is about welcoming with open heart.  Welcome you to my Melbourne Apartment.",100

If you book with me you'll be communicating with both myself and my staff.

I’m an entrepreneur, architecture graduate, photographer, cyclist (NOT the lycra kind), volunteer, adventurer and problem solver.

During my studies I worked at various cafes and architecture offices to save up for shoestring trips around the world. My grandma once told me I had ‘champagne taste but a beer budget’ and it’s a motto I’ve enjoyed applying to different parts of my life to get the more out of less and find enjoyment in the little things.

I love discovering authentic experiences when I travel and I love being able to share the opportunity with others, to live like a local when they travel too.

Some of my most memorable trips have been couch-surfin across Russia while taking the Trans Siberian, living in Helsinki and learning to hand build furniture, riding a vintage steel bicycle through France to race in L’Eroica and buying a car on craigzlist in Los Angeles and driving across the south, east and north coasts to arrive in Vancouver.

My listings are all managed by Beyond a Room and are all given names that I think reflect the character of the property and area. My aim is to give guests a unique and local perspective on the location and share my knowledge and experience of this wonderful city with travellers so that they feel at home.

We love being airbnb hosts and sharing our homes and our beautiful city with others.
We have been airbnb hosts for over four years and during that time we have met amazing and wonderful people from all around Australia and all parts of the world.
We started with the spare room in our own home and now have 20 properties, from high end luxury to family friendly apartments that we offer our guests. We even have a 7 bedroom, 7 bathroom mansion near the sea in St Kilda for larger groups! 
We use airbnb ourselves whenever we travel and feel we know what people are looking for. Good value, great locations, clean, comfortable and friendly! All our properties are in great locations, are professionally cleaned and we use hotel quality, commercially laundered linen on comfortable beds.  We meet all our guests on arrival to say hello and are on hand to offer help, advice and inside tips of places to go and things to see. 
Most of our properties include free parking which is a real bonus in the city and Foxtel (cable) television and other homely touches so you 'can live like a local'. (You can view our properties by clicking the View Full Profile link below and clicking on the listings on the left hand side of the page). 

A little bit about ourselves ... we're pretty easy going, and love getting out and about exploring different places. We are both keen travellers and have done our fair share of it in Australia and overseas - whether backpacking, camping, or an occasional splurge on 5-star resorts! You wouldn't call us 'party animals', but we do like socialising and meeting people.  We enjoy a wide variety of interests, love the movies, eating out, popping down to the beach on our scooter or pushbikes, and enjoying the many exciting sporting events and festivals that Melbourne has to offer.
Our motto is ""strangers are just friends you haven't met yet!""
Wishing you happy travels and looking forward to meeting you soon :-)

I'm fascinated with simply listening to people I meet along life's journey but I'm also very engaged when investigating something new or a little different.  To hear and see how others interpret our world and find ways to enjoy it amazes and inspires me.

Travelling: We absolutely love it and look out for every opportunity to experience new cultures, landscapes and adventures around the world - we have been in more than 30 countries to date and planning to visit a lot more. We speak English, French, Italian and Spanish between the two of us.

Food: Along with travelling, food is another thing we love. We fancy adventuring ourselves in the variety of great diners scattered around Melbourne as well as experiencing different cuisines when travelling.

Cycling/Yoga: One thing that Valerie cannot live without is yoga! Every opportunity is good to roll the mat and practice. I (Davide) love cycling especially very long rides +150km and cycling in the mountains! I cycled the Australian Alps and seek to experience steep up and downhills around the world further. Find me on Strava (Dave March) if you are into cycling.

We have a bright and light private room in our friendly and creative share house, situated in Melbourne's vibrant inner north.  If you fancy good coffee, small bars, food trucks, live music and vintage shopping, then East Brunswick is for you!  You can safely stroll or cycle the inner north (Brunswick, Fitzroy, Carlton) or take a 15 minute tram to the city, before escaping back to the refuge of your peaceful room. LGBTIQ friendly please!","About us: We are four creatives aged between 30 and 41 hailing from Australia, Colombia and Brazil and we have lived communally with one another for a substantial time, in a warm and mature home. This is definitely not a hostel or rooming house situation!  We live in a lovely old Californian bungalow in the leafy heart of diverse Brunswick. We have a large backyard and thriving edible garden and we are happy to welcome you into our happy, well-functioning share house!  The room: There is a choice of two rooms depending on which one of us is away from home for study, work or travel. Both rooms have small double and or queen-sized beds and include wardrobes, dressing tables and desks. We also offer heating and fans to suit the season and clean towels and linen are assured. Hair care / body wash essentials are also provided.  Communal spaces: we have a large backyard that is half paved and half vegetable garden. There is an outdoor setting for use and you are welcome to eat from the garde","I'm a nature-loving, novel-reading, coffee-appreciating, visual-arting, social justice-minded, vegan office worker!

I look forward to connecting and sharing!",39
